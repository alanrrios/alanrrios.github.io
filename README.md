Welcome world to the landing page of the alanrrios.com domain. A simple HTML/CSS copypasta from getbootstrap.com.

The initial page is simple and sweet.

The following page directs you to any links available to follow me. You may notice some empty. They're either being worked on or were reduced. This is a reminder about privacy and its basis on consent.

The work page is for my current career and a link to download my resume to any professionals interested.

To-Do:

- Add a projects page. Projects completed, worked on, or in the works.

- Build site using Node.js.

- Create blog CMS using Node.js technology for a personal blog.
